- This is my Competitive Programming Archive.
- I use a modified version of [CPH VS Code Extension](https://github.com/agrawal-d/cph) available at https://github.com/aryan57/cph
- You can directly download the VSIX file of the modified extension from [here](https://github.com/aryan57/cp-tips/blob/main/competitive-programming-helper-custom-0.0.1.vsix)
- There are two simple scripts, for uploading the codes from a desired folder to github :
  - Windows: [script.bat](https://github.com/aryan57/cp-archive/blob/master/script.bat)
  - Linux: [script.sh](https://github.com/aryan57/cp-archive/blob/master/script.sh)
